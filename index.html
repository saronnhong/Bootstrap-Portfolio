          <p>The wolf and the lion. I would like a trial by combat. When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. I would like a trial by combat. A feast for crows. The Dothraki do things in their own time, for their own reasons. King in the North. The Knight of Lemonwood. What is dead may never die. I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come. Can a man still be brave if heâ€™s afraid? That is the only time a man can be brave.It's ten thousand miles between Kings landing and the wall. Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken. May the Father judge him justly. The winds of Winter.</p>
          <p>It's ten thousand miles between Kings landing and the wall. I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come. Forgive my manners. I don't see many ladies these days. Lucky for the ladies. And now his watch is ended. A Lannister always pays his debts. </p>
          <p>Our Sun Shines Bright. Pay the iron price. Bastards are born of passion, aren't they? We don't despise them in Dorne. The rains of castamere. You know nothing, Jon Snow.</p>
